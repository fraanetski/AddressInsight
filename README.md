## Summary

AddressInsight is a data interface and analysis platform for Ethereum addresses. Blockchain data can be thought of as a 3-layer stack:

<img width="500" alt="stack" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50059514/171098211-f523c44f-4877-4bc6-b9a3-574bde5627c0.png">

AddressInsight builds off RSS3 and KNN3 to make up the Interface Layer and part of the Analysis Layer, thus completing the stack. Of course this is simplifying it to some degree, but it's a useful abstraction with which to think about how AddressInsight interacts with KNN3 and RSS3, and to understand where it fits into the overall efforts made by those technologies.

## Motivation

The two main problems that AddressInsight solves are trust and readability.

### Trust

Scammers are still a major issue in the Crypto world. Until now there has not been a platform that gives you easy to read analysis on an addresses trustworthiness. To solve this issue AddressInsight calculates a "Trust Score" for each address, based off a number of data point concerning their on-chain activities. This enables anyone to get a quick second opinion on someone they may be interacting with.

### Readability

Existing address/block explorer platforms are meant for people with a technical background who already have a deep understanding of how a blockchain works. This leads to a UI that can be intimidating for people with less of a background in the technical side, and thus gravely hurts web3 onboarding. AddressInsight is designed with simplicity and human-readability as top priorities.

## Future Directions

This application is currently only the MVP (minimum viable product). There are many directions in which it can be taken. 

### Doubling down on analysis and interfacing

The most logical place to go from here is to integrate more data and expand on the analysis. We could add in many more types of data from RSS3, KNN3, and possible other sources, and visualize it in more intuitive ways. Then we can add more analysis given this data, to better inform a whole host of activities beyond trust, like marketing for potential drops. 

### Becoming a full social media platform

The app already has wallet login integrated - it just doesn't do anything yet. Using RSS3, we could turn this into a full social media platform, where you can follow addresses and see their newest activity on a live feed.
